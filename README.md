## Disclaimer

If you're here, there is a good chance that your Tegra 3 device is already bricked. But I am not 
responsible for any additional issues that may arise from the (mis)use of the code/information 
contained within this repository, nor can I provide support for it.

## Thanks

[@ktemkin](https://github.com/ktemkin) / [@Qyriad](https://github.com/Qyriad) for their work on 
[fusee-launcher](https://github.com/Qyriad/fusee-launcher), and [@jevinskie](https://github.com/jevinskie) 
for their [Nexus 7 port](https://github.com/jevinskie/fusee-launcher) of the same. Also special 
thanks to [@ktemkin](https://github.com/ktemkin) and [@digetx](https://github.com/digetx) for their 
help/guidance/wisdom, as I almost certainly wouldn't have succeeded in debricking my Nexus 7 
without it. [@pgwipeout](https://github.com/pgwipeout)'s kernel work on Ouya allowed me to keep 
using mine (and retain interest in the device) over the years. Finally, Pyre on the OUYA Saviors 
Discord kindly shipped me a (working) Kickstarter Ouya so that I could figure out how to debrick it.

## License

[GNU General Public License v2.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html). 
fusee-launcher is also released under that, so it seemed fitting.

## Background

Last December I was gifted a bricked 2012 Nexus 7, but it did enumerate via APX mode, and I enjoy a 
challenge :)

## Other Methods

In the months it took me to finally put this repo together after working through this between February and March of 2020, an alternate method was posted to XDA Developers tailored to the Nexus 7.

The following are a couple guides based on this, the first link being the original:

- [Unbrick Nexus 7 with another Tegra 3 Device](https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-7/general/unbrick-nexus-7-tegra-3-device-t4078627) by [Jirmd](https://github.com/GeorgeMato4)
- [[TUTORIAL] How to unbrick Nexus 7 without blob.bin (REQUIRES ANOTHER NEXUS 7 2012)](https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-7/general/tutorial-how-to-unbrick-nexus-7-blob-bin-t4083879) by [enderzip](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=10063311)

It also uses [@jevinskie](https://github.com/jevinskie)'s [fusee-launcher fork](https://github.com/jevinskie/fusee-launcher), but to grab the SBK using their [dump-sbk-via-usb.S](https://github.com/jevinskie/fusee-launcher/blob/n7/dump-sbk-via-usb.S) payload.

The cavaet is that at least at the moment it appears to require another working device to generate the blobs.

That method is not covered here, but is probably worth trying if the steps detailed here don't work for you.

## Nexus 7 (2012 WiFi) Debrick

Before attempting any of this, be sure that your tablet isn't recoverable via other means. A dead/low battery can sometimes be worked around by plugging it in to a [charger and holding down the power button for 30s](https://web.archive.org/web/20200704193425/https://www.howtogeek.com/131109/the-ultimate-nexus-7-troubleshooting-guide-6-potential-problems-and-how-to-fix-them/). Leaving it hooked up to a charger for some time (30+ minutes) can also get them to respond again. Unlike the Ouya, a bad kernel flash is recoverable by forcing the tablet into fastboot recovery with a button combo. Holding the volume down + power button for several seconds can boot into fastboot recovery mode which will allow the kernel to be reflashed. The steps below are only meant as a last resort, like if your bootloader was wiped via a botched update or similar.

### Prerequisites:

- Linux machine with:
	- free USB3 port (required for fusee-launcher) (_Intel chipsets may work more reliably here_)
	- (if 64-bit kernel/userland) 32-bit libraries installed (_for .deb-based distros_ `dpkg --add-architecture i386; apt update && apt install libc6:i386 libstdc++6:i386`)
	- `pyusb` installed (_for .deb-based distros_ `apt install python3-usb`)
	- `fastboot` installed (_for .deb-based distros_ `apt install fastboot`)
	- `adb` installed (_for .deb-based distros_ `apt install adb`)
	- `cbootimage` installed (_for .deb-based distros_ `apt install cbootimage`)
	- recursive clone of this repository (`git clone --recursive https://github.com/tofurky/tegra30_debrick.git`)
- Factory Android .zip for "nakasi". The latest is [nakasi-lmy47v-factory-5a0bb059.zip](https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aosp/nakasi-lmy47v-factory-5a0bb059.zip). Others can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/android/images#nakasi).
- Some basic knowledge/familiarity with Linux command line
- Some basic knowledge/familiarity with flashing Android (e.g. fastboot and adb)

### Steps:

1. Connect Nexus 7 to *USB3* port on Linux machine via Micro-USB jack.
	* If you have reason to believe the battery may be at less than 30% capacity, let it sit there for an hour or two before proceeding. This isn't just to play it safe - the bootloader will refuse to operate in _nvp3server_ mode if it's at <= 29%.

2. Check output of `dmesg` and `lsusb` commands. Take note if the tablet automatically enumerates in APX mode:

	<details><summary><i>Example <code>dmesg</code> output showing enumeration in APX mode:</i></summary>

		    [Sat Jul  4 12:12:44 2020] usb 2-3.4: new high-speed USB device number 86 using xhci_hcd

	</details>

	<details><summary><i>Example <code>lsusb</code> output showing device in APX mode:</i></summary>

		    matt@aquos:~/devel/ouya/tegra30_debrick$ lsusb
		    ...
		    Bus 002 Device 086: ID 0955:7330 NVIDIA Corp. 
		    ...
	</details>

3. If the tablet is not automatically entering APX mode, try the following to coerce it:
	* Open up a terminal window and execute `dmesg -Tw`. This is so you can see the USB enumeration happen in real time.
	* With the tablet plugged into the Linux machine, try holding volume up + power simultaneously for around 10-15 seconds.
	* If that doesn't work, it might help to unplug the internal battery connector. First, unplug the USB cable.
	* Follow the first few steps [here](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nexus+7+Battery+Replacement/9895) to gently remove the rear cover and unplug the battery cable. If you're careful, this can be done without tools.
	* While pressing the volume up button, plug in the USB cable. It's a bit tricky with the cover removed - it should slightly "click" inwards. Using the edge of your fingernail can help. You may need to use more pressure than expected to create electrical contact. (Note: it can take several attempts to get the tablet to actually enumerate. If you continuously see USB errors in `dmesg`, maybe try sharper pressure on the volume up button.)
	* The tablet should then hopefully enumerate in APX mode. If it does, release the volume up button and **reconnect the battery connector** (leave the USB cable plugged in).

4. From APX mode, execute fusee-launcher using [uart\_payload\_n7.bin](/payload/uart_payload_n7.bin). Within the `tegra30_debrick` directory, run:

		    sudo ./fusee-launcher/fusee-launcher.py ./payload/uart_payload_n7.bin -P 7330

5. (Optional) Take a backup of the tablet's BCT **with the unpatched version of nvflash** for safekeeping and potential later use (i.e. use your backup instead of ./bct/nexus_7_grouper_bct.bin in subsequent steps) (Note: APX/nvflash will become unresponsive after this completes successfully - you'll need to cycle power and repeat steps 1 through 4):

	* If you see an error like `bootloader status: Bct file not found (code: 21) message:  flags: 1073893660`, and you're _certain_ that you used the **unpatched** nvflash, it is possible that your BCT is damaged/missing. You will need to use the BCT from this repo (`./bct/nexus_7_grouper_bct.bin`) and add `--sync` to the _EBT_ nvflash command in step 7.

	* If `nvflash` errors out with something along the lines of `bootloader failed NvError 0x0`, it is possible that the battery is not charged enough to continue. The tablet screen will clearly say "battery is too low". If that's the case, cycle power, let it charge, and revisit in an hour or two. The cutoff seems to be 29%.

	* If you had a valid kernel and system image on the device, the tablet may boot into it immediately after flashing EBT. However, this does not mean that the bootloader/BCT were successfully flashed.

	* At this point, it is necessary to perform a cold boot to verify the bootloader and BCT are properly flashed. This can be achieved by holding the power button for approximately 10 seconds. Eventually, you should see a Google logo and the tablet will continue booting into Android if kernel and system partitions are intact.

8. Enter fastboot mode by holding the volume down and power keys for approximately 10s. While holding the buttons, the screen should go blank, briefly flash the Google logo, and then go to the screen with the Android mascot (it also says 'Start' at the top). Release the buttons:

## Ouya Debrick

Before attempting any of this, be sure that your system isn't recoverable via other means. This could be as simple as hooking up a USB cable and running `adb`, or possibly plugging in a USB keyboard and attempting to enter [recovery mode](https://web.archive.org/web/20150502163510/https://forums.ouya.tv/discussion/comment/11742/#Comment_11742).

### Prerequisites:

- Linux machine with:
	- free USB3 port (required for fusee-launcher) (_Intel chipsets may work more reliably here_)
	- (if 64-bit kernel/userland) 32-bit libraries installed (_for .deb-based distros_ `dpkg --add-architecture i386; apt update && apt install libc6:i386 libstdc++6:i386`)
	- `pyusb` installed (_for .deb-based distros_ `apt install python3-usb`)
	- `fastboot` installed (_for .deb-based distros_ `apt install fastboot`)
	- `adb` installed (_for .deb-based distros_ `apt install adb`)
	- recursive clone of this repository (`git clone --recursive https://github.com/tofurky/tegra30_debrick.git`)
- Ouya OTA update .zip (if you had a bad kernel flash, for example)
	- a large .7z with multiple versions can be found [here](https://archive.org/details/OuyaFirmware.7z)
- (if Ouya isn't automatically booting to APX) low ohm resistor (I used 47 ohm) connected to ground with an e.g. wire and/or test clip
	- if you're brave, dextrous, and very careful you _might_ even get away with a paperclip grounded to the springy clip on the edge of the PCB
- Some basic knowledge/familiarity with Linux command line
- Some basic knowledge/familiarity with flashing Android (e.g. fastboot and adb)

### Steps

1. Connect Ouya to power, but leave powered off

2. Connect Ouya to *USB3* port on Linux machine via Micro-USB jack

3. Power on Ouya and check `dmesg` and/or `lsusb` output on Linux machine. Take note if the Ouya automatically enumerates in APX mode:

	<details><summary><i>Example <code>dmesg</code> output showing enumeration in APX mode:</i></summary>

		    ...
	</details>

4. If Ouya is *not* automatically booting to APX mode, do the following:
	* Disassemble Ouya by removing the 4 screws on the top and carefully sliding out PCB. [This iFixit teardown](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Ouya+Teardown/14224) may be helpful.
	* Repeat steps 1 & 2 to reconnect power and Micro-USB cable
	* Taking ESD precautions, connect [pin on PFET](/image/ouya_apx_glitch.jpg) to ground via low ohm resistor (~47 ohm - other values including 0 ohm probably work)
		- Power on Ouya with button
		- Leave PFET pin grounded for approximately 2s after pressing power button. This is about the time it takes for the fan to spin up.
	* If grounding PFET pin doesn't work. There is an alternate method. Otherwise skip to the next step.
	    - Short the [U33 pads](/image/ouya_apx_alternate_method.jpg)
		- Power on Ouya with button
		- Remove short from U33
	* Check Linux `dmesg` output on your PC to see if the Ouya enumerated in APX mode.
		- If it did, but reset afterwards, you've held the PFET to ground for too long.
		- If it didn't, try holding it a small amount longer.

5. From APX mode, execute fusee-launcher using [uart\_payload\_ouya.bin](/payload/uart_payload_ouya.bin). Within the `tegra30_debrick` directory, run:

		    sudo ./fusee-launcher/fusee-launcher.py ./payload/uart_payload_ouya.bin -P 7030

7. (Optional, but recommended) Take partition-by-partition dumps of eMMC by running:

		    for partition in BCT PT EBT EKS GP1 SOS LNX APP CAC UPP MSC USP MDA GPT UDA; do sudo ./utils/nvflash_v1.13.87205_miniloader_patched --resume --read $partition $partition.bin; done

	* Note that the last partition, UDA (userdata), has a decent chance of hanging. If it does, it may be necessary to power cycle the Ouya. To run it as a one-off:

		    sudo ./utils/nvflash_v1.13.87205_miniloader_patched --resume --read UDA UDA.bin

8. If Ouya was not automatically booting to APX mode (e.g. bad kernel)

	* Reflash LNX with e.g. CWM Recovery:

		    sudo ./utils/nvflash_v1.13.87205_miniloader_patched --resume --download LNX ./recovery/recovery-clockwork-6.0.4.8-ouya.img --go

	* From recovery, reflash stock .zip, or `adb reboot-bootloader` to get to fastboot to reflash stock

9. If Ouya was automatically booting to APX mode (i.e. bad/erased bootloader/BCT):

	* Backup LNX partition if you haven't yet done so:

		    sudo ./utils/nvflash_v1.13.87205_miniloader_patched --resume --read LNX LNX.bin

	* Erase LNX partition via _nv3pserver_ mode by uploading all zeroes: 

		    truncate -s 8M LNX_all_zeroes.bin
		    sudo ./utils/nvflash_v1.13.87205_miniloader_patched --resume --download LNX LNX_all_zeroes.bin --go
